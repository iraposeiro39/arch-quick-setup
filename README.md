# Arch quick setup 


This is a script I did in my free time as a way to learn a more about making sh scripts, it was pretty fun to do :)

## Setup

To run the script you need to install git on the archiso

```
pacman -Sy git
```

After that, just clone the repo and make it executable

```
git clone https://github.com/iraposeiro39/arch-quick-setup.git
cd arch-quick-setup-main
chmod +x arch-quick-setup.sh
```

Then execute it and thanks for using it :)

```
./arch-quick-setup.sh
```

If you want to execute it all at once, just copy this:

```
pacman -Sy git && git clone https://github.com/iraposeiro39/arch-quick-setup.git && cd arch-quick-setup-main && chmod +x arch-quick-setup.sh && ./arch-quick-setup.sh
```
